This is an English-language, currently private API for all streets and squares in Berlin named after women. It is built with Django REST Framework.

According to [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20210723104659/https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/beitrag/2020/10/gendergerechte-stadtplanung-gender-mainstreaming-berlin.html) (in German), only 500-600 street names in Berlin are named after women, whereas around 3,000 are named after men. This project aims to catalogue all the streets named after women and provide background history on their eponyms.
